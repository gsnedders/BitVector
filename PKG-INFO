Description: This class presents a pure-Python memory efficient packed representation for bit arrays.
        
        Change introduced in version 1.3.1: Removed the inconsistency in
        the internal representation of bit vectors produced by logical bitwise
        operations vis-a-vis the bit vectors created by the constructor.
        Previously, the logical bitwise operations resulted in bit vectors that
        had their bits packed into lists of ints, as opposed to arrays of
        unsigned shorts.
        
        Changes introduced in version 1.3: (1) One more constructor mode included: When initializing a new bit vector with an integer value, you can now also specify a size for the bit vector.  The constructor zero-pads the bit vector from the left with zeros. (2) The BitVector class now supports 'if x in y' syntax to test if the bit pattern 'x' is contained in the bit pattern 'y'. (3) Improved syntax to conform to well-established Python idioms. (4) What used to be a comment before the beginning of each method definition is now a docstring.
        
        Changes introduced in version 1.2: (1) one more constructor mode: a bit vector can now be constructed directly from a bitstring; (2) rich comparison operators overloaded; (3) minimal length bit vectors constructed from int values; (4) methods provided for extending a bit vector from the left and from the right; (5) a unittest based testing framework incorporated in the package; (6) additional debugging in code and in package setup.
        
        Changes introduced in version 1.1.1: (1) peek feature incorporated in block reads from disk files; (2) it is now possible to construct zero-sized bit vectors.
        
        The class supports the following operators/methods:
        
        __getitem__
        
        __setitem__
        
        __len__
        
        __getslice__
        
        __str__
        
        __iter__
        
        __contains__
        
        __int__
        
        __add__
        
        __eq__, __ne__, __lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__
        
        
        '|'  for bitwise or
        
        '&'  for bitwise and
        
        '^'  for bitwise xor
        
        '~'  for bitwise inversion
        
        '<<' for circular shift to the left
        
        '>>' for circular shift to the right
        
        '+'  for concatenation
        
        intValue(), __int__  for returning the integer value
        
        divide_into_two
        
        permute
        
        unpermute
        
        pad_from_left
        
        pad_from_right
        
        read_bits_from_file
        
        write_to_file
        
        read_bits_from_fileobject
        
        write_bits_to_fileobject
